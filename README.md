## Overview

This project examines the spatial and temporal distribution of fatal overdose risk across census block groups (CBGs) in Cook County, Illinois, from 2020 to 2023. We integrate medical examiner data with satellite-derived environmental indicators, urban form classifications, and social deprivation indices to model relative risk and identify high-risk trends.

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Setup and Data Acquisition

- **Load required packages**: `sf`, `terra`, `tigris`, `tidycensus`, `CARBayesST`, `ggplot2`, `biscale`, and others.
- **Import core datasets**:
  - Cook County CBG boundaries
  - ACS population estimates (2020â€“2023)
  - Green space access (park acres per CBG)
  - Medical examiner overdose fatality data
  - Built environment intensity and nighttime light rasters (from remote sensing)
  - Urban classification raster from GHS-SMOD (mosaicked and extracted by modal class)

### 2. Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering

- Join overdose incidents to CBGs and compute annual fatality counts.
- Merge ACS and green space data with each CBG.
- Extract satellite imagery metrics per CBG:
  - **Built environment intensity** (median)
  - **Nighttime light** (median)
  - **NDVI** (greenness index from Landsat)
- Integrate **Area Deprivation Index (ADI)** using `sociome::get_adi()`.

### 3. Statistical Modeling

- Fit Poisson GLMs using:
  - Park access, urban classification, and ADI (continuous and quintile versions)
- Create a long panel dataset for 2020â€“2023 overdose counts.
- Fit a **spatiotemporal Bayesian Poisson model** (`ST.CARar`) using `CARBayesST`:
  - Includes spatial adjacency matrix for CBGs
  - Year-centered trend, park access, greenness, ADI quintile, built-up area, and light intensity
- Calculate fitted values and relative risk (RR) by CBG and year.

### 4. Visualization

- Generate static and faceted maps of RR using `ggplot2` and `sf`
- Identify **high-risk areas** where RR > 1.5
- Plot **temporal RR trends** and **observed overdose counts** from 2020â€“2023
- Create **bivariate maps** (e.g., ADI Ã— light intensity) using `biscale` and `cowplot`
- Classify CBGs by **trend type**: increasing, decreasing, sharply increasing, or stable risk
- Visualize trend classification across urban form categories

## Outputs

- Modeled overdose relative risk maps (2020â€“2023)
- High-risk area identification and classification
- GLM and CAR model summaries
- NDVI, urban form, and light intensity integration
- Trend slope and curvature maps
- Aggregated trends by urban classification
